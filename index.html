                <p id="p1">My name is Sean Amodeo and I was born and raised in Toronto in a family of four children. I gained an early interest in neuroscience and psychology and went to McMaster University for my post-secondary education, studying Health Sciences. While at McMaster and for a couple years post graduation, I spent some time doing research in a number of areas such as neuroscience, psychiatry and medical-legal issues. With the intent of entering the field of psychiatry, I enrolled in medical school at the University of Toronto. However, during my third year of medicine I came to realize that I was more interested in theory as opposed to practice, and decided that medical school was not where I was supposed to be</p>
                <p>This was a difficult decision and during the months after my withdrawal I did a lot of introspection regarding what I find stimulating and rewarding, with the help of an occupational psychologist. Computers and computer science have always been hobbies and fascinations of mine and I decided to make this into a career. I plan on using web development as a launching point into programming and computer science in general.</p>
                <p>My long term dream is to merge programming with neuroscience by entering the field of computational neuroscience, which models the brain and its processes through computing. Creating more sophisticated neural networks and achieving the possibility of true artificial intelligence is something that fascinates me to no end, but I have a long way to go before I can involve myself in this field. </p>
